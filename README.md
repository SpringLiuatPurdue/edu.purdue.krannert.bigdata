This repository contains code for assignments, labs, and demos that are part of MGMT 590 Big Data.
Within the subdirectories are a mix of shell and python scripts, as well as some data files and SQL queries.
You will need to use an appropriate IDE or service to be able to make use of the scripts and files to do something meaningful.

To be able to use the Python code within the subdirs, I suggest that you set up a Python virtual environment and install the python dependencies within requirements.txt in the outermost directory.
